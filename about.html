<h3>About </h3>
   <table height=200><tr><td valign=top class='null'>
Firstly, thank you for downloading Spy Watch!<br><br>

     <b> What is Spy Watch?</b> <br>

    Spy Watch is a privacy extension that aims to create transparency
     in third party internet tracking. Our hope is
     that further transparency can change the way online tracking is
     discussed at the policy level. <br><br>

     <b> How do I use Spy Watch? </b> <br>

     After you've downloaded/installed Spy Watch, continue to browse
     normally. When you visit a page, click the spy icon (in your
     toolbar) and you'll see a popup with a list of sites. These
     sites are tracking you, and currently know you're visiting that page.

     Clicking on the blue icon next to the sites in the list will take
     you to the CookieCert page for that site. CookieCert provides more
     information on the cookies left by certain tracking sites. Please
     keep in mind however, that not all tracking sites will have
     entries on CookieCert.
     
     Clicking on a site will allow you to see the other pages this
     site knows you've visited. 

     Clicking on "All tracking sites" will allow you to see every site
     that has ever tracked you. <br><br>

     <b> What happens with the data generated by Spy Watch? </b> <br>

     Nothing! All user data is stored locally in the browser. In fact,
     clicking on "Clear Data" will clear all of Spy Watch's data. The
     creator of this extension cannot access your data. <br><br>


     <b> How do I stop these sites from tracking me? </b><br>

     Unfortunately, Spy Watch only informs users of trackers and
     cannot block them.

     However, there are many chrome extensions that do block trackers!
     If you're interested, check out DoNotTrackMe or Ghostery. <br><br>
     
     
     <b> Who created Spy Watch? </b> <br>
     Spy Watch was created by Neel Guha, a high school student from
     the Bay Area. If you have any additional questions, comments, or
     concerns you can contact him at neelguha@gmail.com
